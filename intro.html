Take time to wander along beautiful, sun-kissed beaches before enjoying a bite to eat at one of the Gold Coast&rsquo;s bustling cafes. Ride a wave at renowned surf breaks, or take a short drive from the coastline to visit the world heritage listed Gondwana Rainforests. Discover lookouts and magnificent waterfalls that will take your breath away and enjoy the refreshing vibe in the shade of impressive treetop canopies. <br /><br />A visit to the Gold Coast can only be complete once you have spent at least a day meeting all your favourite characters and whizzing through the air on rollercoasters at a theme park. For more excitement, join a jet boat ride and race across the Broadwater, or take a happy snap at the top of the SkyPoint climb.<br /><br />No matter what your holiday style or reason for taking a break, the Gold Coast has an array of eclectic experiences for a trip to remember long after you return home &ndash; there is something for everyone.</p>
